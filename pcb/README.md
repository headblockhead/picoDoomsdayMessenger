# PCB Files
The files in this directory can be used to manufacture a copy of the PCB used in this project. They are here as a backup in case EASYEDA is ever taken down. The files are also here in case you want to make a copy of the PCB for yourself.
You can find the files online at this [open source hardware lab page](https://oshwlab.com/headblockhead/picodoomsdaycommunicator).

## PCB Design
The PCB was designed using [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/). The design files can be found in the [EasyEDA project](https://oshwlab.com/headblockhead/picodoomsdaycommunicator). The design files are also in this directory.

## V1 vs V1.1
The difference between V1 and V1.1 is that the logo and text on the PCB have been moved to the silkscreen layer. In V1, the logo and text were on the soldermask layer. This meant that the logo and text were hard to see in low light conditions. The logo and text are now on the silkscreen layer which means that they are easier to see in low light conditions.
