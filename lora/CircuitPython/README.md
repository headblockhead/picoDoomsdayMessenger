# CircuitPython Example

This lora example was used by me as a sanity check to make sure that the LoRa module was working correctly. It is an example that sends a message over LoRaWAN every second and prints received messages to the i2c OLED display. It is basically a PingPong program. This example can also be used to test the LoRa module range.
